Who has time to search through Craigslist? Python does.

A simple script that does a simple thing: scrapes Craigslist and emails you what it finds. On first run, it creates a 
text file containing time-stamped links. On subsequent runs, it checks to see if it's already collected the links it 
finds - if it hasn't, that's something new that you need to know about. Boom, it emails them to you.

Looking for sold-out concert tickets? Jetskis? Free furniture? Set this up to run periodically with Task Scheduler or 
whatever you like. Let Python do all the work for you!
